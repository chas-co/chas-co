## Projects

### Operator Control Console - JavaScript, Codesys PLC
This project was developed on the Exor International Jmobile platform for use by operators on gas stand test cells at
Cummins Turbo Technologies. Two encoders and 3 buttons were connected to the HMI through a plugin module and
configured in CodeSys software. JavaScript code was written to allow the operator to use the encoders for signal
command control of two systems between a fixed minimum and maximum value. JavaScript code was also written to
send signal command value and button states to the main control system through Modbus communication protocol.

### Finance Calculator - Python
This project was built to help users either interested in investing their money or buying property. The calculator provides
the choice for users to calculate return on their investments applying simple or compound interest. The calculator also
allows users to calculate how much monthly repayments they would have to make on a house with a given value.
